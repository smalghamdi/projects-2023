## Title:

Creating a FAIR and Harmonized Ontology for Diseases and Phenotypes

## Description:

The Human Disease Ontology (DOID), MONDO Disease Ontology (MONDO), and
Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) are the three major ontologies being widely
used in the biomedical research community. There are significant overlaps
among the three ontologies. Although the overlapping terms of DOID and
MONDO supposedly cross reference each other, due to the lack of consensus
agreement or the standardized data exchange protocols, the two ontologies
are not in sync. The developers of MONDO and HPO work closely together.
Although the phenotypes and diseases are not always the same,  these two
ontologies end up overlapping with each other, especially within the rare
disease domain. The overlaps across these three ontologies were not
properly mapped and referenced, which creates problems including usersâ€™
confusion in adoption, and introduces siloed data systems. This project
aims to create a FAIR and harmonized ontology for diseases and phenotypes
by merging DODI, MONDO and HPO using Lexical OWL Ontology Matcher alignment
and logical reasoner to ensure coherent. To achieve coherence, we must
sacrifice some expressiveness by eliminating axioms that lead to
inconsistencies. This axiom removal phase can be prioritized in multiple
ways, resulting in multiple ontologies.

The objectives for the hackathon includes, but not limited to:

   1. Examine and evaluate different variations of harmonized ontologies, in
   terms of:
	   1. Structure
	   2. Coverage
	   3. Number and quality of removed axioms
	   4. Application based quantitative evaluation.
   2. Release the ontology (v.1) following the FAIR principles.
   3. Write up a draft manuscript for publication.
